# These are the config variables for your addon.
#
# You can access these variables in your add-on by:
# $this->config['my_config_var'] or
# $this->fetchConfig('my_config_var', 'a fallback value')
#
# A personal preference:
# Define all your config vars in default.yaml, but only
# display important ones that you want your users to customize in here.
# If they want to override the defaults, they can do so in here.
